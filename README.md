# EGGCN: Efficient Group Graph Convolutional Network for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of EGGCN, along with scripts to train and evaluate the model on the Kinetics Skeleton 400, NTU RGB+D 60, and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets. The repository also includes scripts to reproduce the experiments reported in our paper, as well as ablation studies to analyze the impact of different design choices.

<center>
    Framework: EGGCN is a novel model for skeleton-based action recognition, which achieves comparable performance on several large-scale datasets. The model uses a group spatial-temporal graph convolution to extract hierarchical features from the input skeleton sequences, and leverages efficient design choices to reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of the model.
